# Scalene love triangle

## Description
This is a card game project inspired by Liar Liar anime.

It runs automatically with different output (winner) every time. 

It consists of two players and 20 cards split evenly.

## Rules
The cards have relative values, and whoever plays the higher card gets both cards.

If it's a draw, the cards stay on the board and whoever wins the next round gets the lot.


This is how the game should look like:

Here are the values:

## Future updates
1. Automation of the game by making a human vs robot game.
2. Inclusion of more card sets (+ abilities)
3. Add a new flag: status for cards to make the backend more easily to work with.
